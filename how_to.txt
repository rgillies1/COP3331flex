AsterRisk, an ncurses shooting game
By Raymond Gillies

HOW TO PLAY:
(NOTE: This game uses ncurses, a Linux-only library. Therefore, these instructions are Linux-only)
1. Place the AsterRisk folder in the desired directory
2. Navigate to the AsterRisk folder using the following command 
(replace <AsterRisk directory> with the directory you placed the folder in):
cd <AsterRisk directory>/AsterRisk
3. Run the game by opening the a.out file:
./a.out
OR if a.out does not exist, compile the code using the following command:
g++ *.cpp ./implementation/*.cpp ./implementation/Units/*.cpp -pthread -lncurses -O3
AND if necessary, set the permissons for a.out so you can execute it:
chmod 700 a.out
Then run the file as described at step 3.

The instructions to play the game are shown before the game starts.
Have fun!
